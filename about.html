            <h2>About</h2>
            
            <section class="bio">
                <p>Max Giuliana is a geopolitical analyst, strategist, and writer whose work lives at the intersection of global risk, public policy, and principled decision-making. Currently at Hilco Global's Geopolitical Unit, Max helps institutional clients—from Fortune 500s to PE-backed operators—understand how macro-level shocks affect bottom-line realities. He contributes to Hilco's flagship geopolitical reports, crafts scenario-based forecasts, and delivers on-demand advisory services rooted in geopolitical first principles and practical urgency.</p>
                
                <p>Before Hilco, Max was a founding team member and Associate at MKF Advisors, a government affairs firm he helped build from the ground up. There, he led operations, designed internal systems, and directly advised clients on federal and state funding strategy, especially around infrastructure, public safety, and technology policy. He also served as Executive Director of Taking the Hill PAC, advancing veterans running for public office—raising over $250,000 and scaling communications outreach.</p>
                
                <p>Max's career began on the front lines of American government, working in the U.S. House of Representatives with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Congressman Brendan Boyle. He later contributed to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's transition team on public safety strategy. Across these roles, Max has built a reputation for clarity, rigor, and an ability to translate complexity into action.</p>

                <h3>Beyond the Work</h3>
                <p>But Max's work is also personal. He's a deep generalist, drawn to big ideas and enduring questions—why societies rise and fall, how institutions endure, and what it means to live well in modernity. Academically, he studied political theory, economics, and American power at George Washington University, graduating summa cum laude. His heroes include Charlie Munger, Lee Kuan Yew, and Ben Franklin. His bookshelf ranges from Security Analysis to The Brothers Karamazov. He reads daily, lifts weights five times a week, and believes that good investing and good living both require discipline, clear thinking, and delayed gratification.</p>
                
                <p>In conversation, Max ranges widely—from AI, venture capital, and sports analytics to theology, Cold War diplomacy, and the aesthetics of Paul Graham's essays. He's building a personal blog to house essays that blend theory with tactics, and he's designing a new content platform—part Letterboxd, part Socratic salon—for those who believe that good taste, strong thinking, and curiosity still matter.</p>

                <h3>Guiding Purpose</h3>
                <p>Whether advising clients, writing essays, or building ventures, Max is motivated by the same through-line: to help people navigate complexity with clarity, conviction, and a sense of higher purpose.</p>
