        <p>You can just do things. It's a phrase that's been claimed by Silicon Valley, but its reality extends far beyond San Francisco. To me, it was a profound realization. One that didn't quite strike me until I was 18 years of age. Perhaps it was Covid's solitude, or the stark heatwave of reality that was an initial college experience that forced this reflection upon me, but much like our realization of consciousness—I realized you can just do things.</p>

        <p>Hailing from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, I grew up around cops, mechanics, teachers, and hairdressers. I have a deep respect for these folks; their grit and action through discomfort is and always will be inspiring. The character and culture of blue-collar individuals will forever play a core role in shaping who I am. The emotional strength and grounded perspectives of those with calluses on their hands is imperative to any strong society.</p>

        <p>Despite the tremendous character and valiance of their love, the town I grew up in was missing something. In my youth I could never quite uncover this missing item. In fact, I don't think I ever consciously acknowledged its lack of existence. Instead, its impact was painted over our lives in silence and without identification. That missing item was control.</p>

        <p>Control, not over others or over external things. Rather, control over one's own life. Going to school and work, on someone else's time. Depending on someone else for your income, days off, and the work you get to do. In the process of life these routines become rites of passage. Without realization, we succumb to someone else's goals and vision of reality. First it's school, then it's university, then it's a job. These routines are structure, they are stable in instances, but they are not ours.</p>

        <p>It was truly only upon being thrust into college, and being forced to face the realization that my immediate actions will determine what I do for a living once I exist such a system that forced me to ask: What do I really want to do? Not an easy question. Not one that I have a fully certain answer to today. But what was easier to answer is what I didn't want to do. To sum that up, it was living on someone else's terms. That was and is a non-starter. I have one life, we have one life. To live it anyone else's way is preposterous.</p>

        <p>The question first then is, what is worth doing? I was able to figure out that, to me, this is anything that: makes the world a better place, creates positivity, involves enjoying time with family and friends, and deepens our experience of life. These buckets can be broad based on one's interpretation, but they are a strong framework that can derive many great actions.</p>

        <p>From here, the question becomes, how do I go about doing the things that live my values? In my experience, this has been a practice in intentionality. Our lives are a medium of transportation. Transporting us from experience to experience. If we don't have any concrete, focused, and disciplined north star, we waste this gift of an experience floating around without a destination. Knowing this, I established the practice of constantly evaluating what I'm doing in the moment, why I'm doing it, and what actions can I control that take me closer to ultimately living my values to the maximum capacity possible.</p>

        <p>When I first uncovered this framework, my action was to transfer to a better college. This involved taking harder classes, meeting new people, and living in a new city. Countless similar changes have happened in my life since this moment. This framework can be constant, a routine to practice, and it works with discipline and quality in execution. However, it misses one component, a component of drastic change. One I've come to call inertia.</p>

        <p>Inertia is an action that shakes the walls of life; inertia is an action outside the guardrails; inertia is an acutely self-aware action that shows how one acknowledges their present existence and actively choosing to take action outside their current domain, routine, and personality to fundamentally alter the reality they live in. Inertia is an action that understands that the world around us has been made by people just like us, and that action puts our fundamental imprint on the world with intentionality and vigor.</p>

        <p>Acts of inertia are an exertion of control of one's own life that I felt were missing in my youth. They are acts that reclaim control over reality. It can be as simple as talking to a stranger on the train or as complex as moving across the world. Acts of inertia are a reclaiming of your inner monologue and outer existence. They say, no, this is my life, and here's how I want to live it.</p>

        <p>For me, these acts have been moving to two new cities, transferring colleges, starting a few companies, making multiple new sets of friends, learning new subjects, expressing different aspects of my personality, exploring new countries, loving wholly, and attempting to radically be my authentic self—amongst a host of other daily actions that don't make the headlines.</p>

        <p>Realizing that this world around you is all made up, and that you have the free will to just do things, is the most rebellious thing you can do. Furthermore, it is the most freeing thing you can do. It grounds the tall skyscrapers and inflates your small ideas. It loosens the weight of your boss's criticism and heightens the love of your fleeting interactions. It is an extreme realization that is the foundation upon which great individuals, families, communities, and societies can be built.</p>

        <p>So hasten your action, inflate your confidence, become an egotistical utilitarian. Embrace that you shape this world, that you spread your values, and that this life is yours. Without you, none of what exists around you, ever would have. The future is ours to make up, and that's a beautiful thing.</p>
