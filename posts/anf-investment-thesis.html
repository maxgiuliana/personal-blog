        <h2>ANF Investment Thesis</h2>
        <h3>A Second Look at Abercrombie's Value</h3>
        
        <p><em>Published July 26, 2025</em></p>

        <p>Roughly a year and a half ago I took my first position in $ANF. The idea for an investment started by simply looking around me. I realized that my friends and I had started to wear considerably more Abercrombie in recent months, and that their rebrand was an absolute hit amongst people my age.</p>

        <p>Seeing this trend, I looked into the company's financials, the management team (specifically CEO Fran Horowitz), and felt confident making an investment given the rebrand's continuing growth potential, management's capital allocation, and the healthy balance sheet. In a short time, the stock's value was realized, and eventually was overvalued due to its trendiness and general hype. I exited my position.</p>

        <p>Fast forward to today and the stock has seen a reversal of last year's momentum. It is currently priced at almost half of its peak from a year ago. I simply ask, is $ANF worth half of what it was last year? Of course not. Now, the next logical step is to determine fair value for the company.</p>

        <p>Currently, $ANF has an earnings yield of 16% and a ROIC of 53.6% - extremely impressive numbers. Additionally, in Q1 and Q2 2025 the company repurchased $400m worth of shares with $900m in buybacks still available to management, who have continually indicated in both their words and actions that these buybacks will continue.</p>

        <p>$ANF is a fairly simple business, it can be split into the Hollister and Abercrombie Brands. Hollister is currently experiencing 20+% growth in revenue YoY, and although Abercrombie brand's sales have stalled over the past year, the brand saw 26% growth in revenue in 2024 and grew greater than 50% from 2022 to 2024. Furthermore, these gains have come as management has been phasing out oversized flagship stores and is steadily closing hundreds of underperforming mall stores.</p>

        <p>Knowing all this, I see the valuation as follows. We can conservatively estimate normalized EPS to be $9.5. The current multiple sits at 9x, but historical multiples average 14-16x. For the sake of this valuation we will use 12x. Additionally, we will assume that buybacks continue, and that earnings growth continues at a very conservative 5% per year. Under these assumptions, given the shareholder friendly management practices, strong brand growth, earnings yield, ROIC, and re-rating of the multiple I see an intrinsic value of around $170 per share for $ANF. Given the current price of $93 - I see a strong margin of safety and attractive potential returns in $ANF as the company weathers the tariff storm and continues its brand strength.</p>
