        <p>I've noticed that in the past two years I, and those around me, have felt a special reverence for Anthony Bourdain. Whether it's an image of him on a Pinterest board, or a heartfelt reel narrated by one of his signature monologues - Anthony Bourdain's style and perspective serve as pillars for my generations coming of age. Not those imagined high-school stories, but the gut-punch coming of age that are the post-college graduation blues that leave you asking - Who am I? What do I do? What even matters? Lucky for us, we have Uncle Tony to give us some guidance.</p>

        <p>Although Anthony would have, and we all do, loathe the glorification of optimization and the algorithmic nature of culture, these challenges have catalyzed the resurgence of Anthony's shows, writings, and values. As we scroll on reels, eat our bowl of human chow (Chipotle), and resign our futures to a life of renting - the importance of living in the present and having uniquely human experiences becomes exponentially greater with each breath.</p>

        <p>In many ways, authenticity has become its own currency. It is the differentiator. Authenticity shows that you can think, that you actually do think, and you have your why in a world full of irrelevance. Nobody was better at this than Anthony Bourdain, and when contextualized in a world of large-language-models and short-form content, he becomes an almost religious figure.</p>

        <p>Before it was cool, Anthony had a deep understanding of what valuable and undeniably real experiences are. He understood the concept in a way that only a man who has suffered and ruminated on the pain of not being fulfilled in life can. He saw that one day we will leave this life, and it's not the new shoes that make you happy, but the medium-rare smash burger with a slightly-foamy lager on a Thursday afternoon that you still yearn for six months down the line. He saw that it's not the job you remember, but the people you worked with. And maybe most of all, he saw that there is no more powerful peacemaker than actually walking in someone else's shoes.</p>

        <p>Being a chef was his vehicle into these discoveries. With the short-tenure jobs, makeshift nights out, and unending uncertainty that comes with the profession he was thrust into these life lessons. It might just be that for all of us now, many career paths can feel the same. Staying at a company for 10 years? Never going to happen. Pension? Forget about it. Owning a home? Don't want to even ask the question. So, what are you left with? You're left asking ourselves what really matters. You might find yourself thinking, when I'm on my death bed, what am I going to wish I had done? Most of the time, the answer isn't stay in my hometown forever, work a job I can tolerate, and retire for four years before I die of a heart attack at 72 from all the caffeine I had to ingest to make the job tolerable.</p>

        <p>Instead, many people are realizing they want to try to live a little bit like Mr. Bourdain. A little unstable, a little pretentious, but at least doing something unique. Trying to live an interesting story of a life. Maybe you have a martini in the snow, enter a poker tournament with no qualifications (you can't take it with you), or smoke a cigarette on a cold night because it makes you feel cool.</p>

        <p>Anthony Bourdain never had to say these messages out loud, and on the occasion he did, the point landed with the weight of a black hole. Instead, he lived them. Traveling the world, especially to the parts most western backpack warriors don't think to touchdown in, eating food, asking questions, and telling stories with everyone. Learning a thing or two, and scoring the occasional stomach virus. It wasn't perfect, and a lot of times it wasn't pretty, but isn't that life. In a world of algorithms and aimlessness, be like Anthony. Be Authentic.</p>
